Task 1: Minilanguage Specification

Deliverables: 

    Lexic.txt (file containing mini language lexic description; see example)

    token.in (containing the list of all tokens corresponding to the minilanguage)

    Syntax.in - the syntactical rules of the language

- statements:

- assignment

- input/output

- conditional

- loop
